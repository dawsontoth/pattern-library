<p><strong>Please not this does not include any editor interface elements</strong></p>

<h2>How this works</h2>

<p>The pattern library is built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and uses it&rsquo;s <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/">posts</a> structure for each of the components. By default you must use the following format for Jekyll posts <code>YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.html</code>. However, this format is hacked here to allow you to order the components on the index page. For example, the top component will have the lowest post-name like so <code>0001-01-01-ff-button.html</code>. In this way it&rsquo;s possible to order components.</p>
