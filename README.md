The full list of controls for Firefly's Interface.

**Please not this does not include any editor interface elements**

## How this works

The pattern library is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Patterns are all contained within the `_patterns` folder. Example pages live within the `_examples` folder. Adding a new file in either of these folders will automatically add that pattern or example to the site.
