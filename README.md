## How this works

The pattern library is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and uses it's [posts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) structure for each of the components. By default you must use the following format for Jekyll posts `YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.html`. However, this format is hacked here to allow you to order the components on the index page. For example, the top component will have the lowest post-name like so `0001-01-01-ff-button.html`. In this way it's possible to order components.
